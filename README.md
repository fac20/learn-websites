# Learn websites

Learning to be a web developer in the modern world involves picking up a ton of JavaScript-focused single-page application stuff. This makes it easy to miss out on learning how to make what is still the fundamental building block of the webâ€”regular old websites.

This workshop aims to show you how to build a content-driven site (e.g. a dev blog/portfolio). It'll cover some important things like:

- Generating markup from templates
- Search-engine optimisation (coming soon)
- Social media previews (coming soon)

We're (eventually) going to be using a "static site generator" called [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/).

## Introduction

Here are some slides on how websites work, from HTTP through to static-site generators: https://fac-slides.netlify.app/slides/how-websites-work/.

## Getting started

If you prefer learning by jumping in and experimenting then head to the [project criteria](/project.md). You need to create a website that has each of the specified features. The [reference](/reference.md) contains quick examples of all the Eleventy features you should need. If you want a more complete example the `example/` directory contains a small Eleventy site.

If you'd rather follow a slower-paced guide head to the [walkthrough](/walkthrough.md) and follow along.
